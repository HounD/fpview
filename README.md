# fpview - View minutia generated by NBIS.

NIST provides a library for fingerprint processing ([NBIS](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/nbis.cfm)). 
The `mindtct` in the library outputs several test files with the minutia description. The current package
could be used to visualize the fingerprint data produced by the said application.
